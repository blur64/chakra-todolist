# chakra-todolist
## About
Every frontend programmister should write at least one todolist, but ten is better (three in vanilla JS, two in TS, and others five using 
different frameworks).

Created using cool [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/) ui lib.

Inside:
* Task adding, deleting and editing
* Tasks filtering
* Completeness progress displaying
* Local storage saving
* Some tests using Jest
